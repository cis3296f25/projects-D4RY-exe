# DAW with Music Writing Assistance
My project will have an overall simple Digital Audio Workstation in java, currently featuring 
a virtual piano interface. My goal is to perhaps allow recording and editing, but mainly Iâ€™d 
like to implement an algorithmic music creation tool that implements music theory formulas. 
Unlike the majority of DAWs that primarily focus on mixing, I want to create a project that 
assists with the creation of musical ideas.
